## Overview
**THOR** is a powerful, flexible HTML and CSS template designed and built to revolutionize web development. It provides a versatile foundation that supports a wide variety of projects, bringing consistency, best practices, adaptability, Interoperability, and accessibility into a single, reusable package. With THOR, developers can quickly create efficient, scalable web applications without having to worry about adhering to modern standards and principles.

<br />

## Why THOR?
**THOR** is designed with a clear vision in mind:
- **Template-driven**: A reliable base structure that acts as a starting point for any web application or website. THOR eliminates repetitive setup by providing a standardized framework, ensuring rapid project initialization.
- **Heuristic**: Built on practical, experience-based problem-solving, THOR’s patterns are intuitive and naturally guide developers to follow best practices for clean, maintainable code.
- **Omni-design**: A comprehensive design approach that supports multiple needs—whether it's a simple static page or a complex dynamic web application. THOR’s design versatility adapts to your project's demands.
- **Resource**: THOR is a foundational resource, readily available to developers for building consistent, performant, and accessible web experiences. It provides a toolkit you can rely on, enabling streamlined and cohesive development across multiple projects.

<br />

## Key Features
- **Rapid Initialization**: Kickstart new projects with a solid foundation that already implements core best practices in HTML and CSS, reducing time spent on setup.
- **Heuristic Design Patterns**: THOR’s structure guides developers towards creating intuitive and maintainable web applications, with problem-solving baked in from the start.
- **Omni-Design Flexibility**: Adapt to any project requirements with ease. THOR’s flexible structure works seamlessly across a variety of use cases, from small, static websites to larger, dynamic applications.
- **Accessibility Built-in**: Adheres to modern accessibility standards to ensure web applications are inclusive and usable by all users. Accessible design is integral to the structure.
- **Scalability and Reusability**: THOR is designed to be a reusable resource that scales well with growing projects, allowing easy expansion without compromising on maintainability.

<br />

## Getting Started
1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/your-repo/thor-template.git
   ```
2. **Install Dependencies** (if applicable):
   ```sh
   npm install
   ```
3. **Customize for Your Project**: Replace the default content with your own, and adjust the styles or components as needed. The template’s structure is flexible, allowing you to easily add or remove sections.

<br />

## Usage Guidelines
- **Separation of Concerns**: Keep HTML for structure, CSS for styling, and JavaScript for interactivity (if needed). THOR is designed with these principles at the forefront.
- **Progressive Enhancement**: Start with a solid, accessible base that works universally, then enhance as needed. THOR provides the foundational structure to support this approach.
- **Adaptability**: Feel free to modify and extend THOR. The template is intended to serve as a resource that evolves with your project.

**THOR**: More than a template—a revolution in how we build for the web.






<!-- # INTRO : :
Why are we reinventing the GUI wheel every time there's a new client with a different data set? We use templated variations for virtually every other part of the web application development process, why not for the GUI? 

THOR represents 25+ years of web application development, convention, and usability best practices. THOR is an aggregation and consolidation of the most common requirements and features. THOR is an all in one data, resolution, and JS framework agnostic, single page GUI template.

Search, triage, analyse, and take action without ever leaving the page.

# FEATURES : :
### MANAGEMENT : :
---
* Fully operational professional CMS to triage your data in a third of the time to build it yourself 
* ROAD MAP : :
  * Having the GUI and list of optional features up front, before the project begins, (AKA Road Map) allows clients and  management to more accurately negotiate iterative processes and priorities over limited time frames (AKA Agile friendly) 
  * The Road Map allows management to easily divvy up and plan out iterative development blocks with developers 
  * The Road Map minimizes "communication and interpretation gaps" between clients, management, and developers. No more "going back to the drawing board".
  * The Road Map allows clients to have a better idea of what they are getting 
  * The Road Map helps focus on and define features and functionality and PREVENT scope creep. 
* Double your analyst's production in half the time 
* Ready to connect to your data 
* Future proofed
  * No upgrade coordination conflicts/dead-ends
  * Simplified code base and minimal code nesting and obfuscation = less ramp-up time for future developers 
  * [W3C](https://w3.org)/[WHATWG](https://whatwg.org/) Standards Compliant = works in all standards compliant browsers
  * Separation of concerns = defined developer swim lanes
  * Web Components enables decoupling and hot-swappable future JS frameworks 
  * Fully documented 
* Works with all current major JS frameworks or completely on its own 
* System status page similar to https://www.githubstatus.com/
* Data ingest handles multiple large and small data sets 
* Customizable user metrics dashboard 
* Customizable data metrics dashboard 
* At a glance data up/down time indicators 
<br />

### DEVELOPERS : :

DESCRIPTION : : Combines a master/detail workflow, with a Holy Grail layout pattern and a "reactive" CSS GUI to achieve a simple, optimized, minimal, lightweight, scalable, "unopinionated" (compatible with any JavaScript framework), HTML/CSS scaffolding framework.
* [W3C](https://w3.org)/[WHATWG](https://whatwg.org/) Standards Compliant 
* Cross/backward browser compatible and tested - FF60.530esr, IE11, Edge, Chrome65
* Fully documented (Bootstrap + intuitive naming convention + commented)
* CSS first Initiative  
* GPU accelerated CSS (100 to 1000 times faster than equivalent JS solutions) 
* NEW loading data paradigm (reactive CSS live data detection)
* Separation of concerns between data and UI logic
* HTML5 Routing (with options) allows for bookmarking/sharing links of full layouts and data
* HTML5 User Storage allows for preferences to be saved cross browser session
* Data agnostic
* Framework agnostic - Web Components works with all major JS frameworks or completely on its own
* Resolution agnostic - (Responsive - works with any screen resolution)
* Fast loading/lightweight (up to 50% less markup)
* Minimal dependencies (none if possible) 
* "Holy Grail" layout leverages full browser width/height for maximum data visibility
* Toasts
* Flex-box used for all elements 
* No absolutely positioned elements 
* Web push notifications
* Customize-able display density 
* Optimized and streamlined codebase 
* Defines and separate developer swim lanes
* User metrics system 
* Data metrics system 
* Robust
* Scalable

## REVIEWS : :
---
>"Searching for something? Who isn't... You need this. Increased analysis workflow production by 65% in a fraction of the time it would have taken us to build it ourselves. Time is money. We saved so much money on this one." 

>"Is your project stuck in upgrade limbo? We were too. This application GUI has no dependencies so the developers don't have to wait on third party vendors to make changes and or upgrade! We are moving forward getting things done while the next department is stuck in incompatibility land." 

>"Ever been told that your data stream is down because systems upstream upgraded their hardware/software last month and if you want to play, you have to upgrade too?"
