 SAVE TIME/MONEY : :
* Epiphany after 20+ years of GUI development, why are we reinventing the GUI wheel every time we get a new client with a data set?  
* Same predictable meetings with clients negotiating requirement and priorities. A year+ development with more and more meetings.  
* Most want/need the same thing - to be able to easily search and quickly find/see results, study details of items found, and act upon what they found. 
* Seeing the GUI up front allows clients and team management to more accurately negotiate priorities and features over limited time frames (AKA Agile friendly).
* Seeing the GUI up front minimizes "communication and interpretation gaps" between clients, management, and developers. Never have to "go back to the drawing board".
* "Road map" helps focus on and define features and functionality and PREVENT scope creep. 
* Minimal third party resource/asset dependencies keeps a clear path for future upgrades. Reduces potential for development "road blocks" due to depending on divested third party developers introducing bugs or waiting on updates to coordinate incomparable code. (Part of "future proofing")

QUALITY ASSURANCE : :
* This GUI ensures application quality, robust, scalable, "future proofed" design and development. 
* W3C standards driven, cross/backward browser compatible.
* Minimal dependencies and minimal code nesting 

OPTIMIZE (ANALYST) WORKFLOW : : 
* Time is of the essence for analysts. How can I optimize the workflow for the analysts?  
* By far the biggest time consumer was navigating back and forth between search results and an item's details (ping-pong affect). 
* How can I build a GUI where analysts don't have to leave the page to see content? Have everything all on one page.

OPTIMIZE (DEVELOPER) WORKFLOW : : 
* Separation of GUI logic and data logic defines developer roles, responsibilities, priorities, and "swim lanes".
* Pre-made, copy/paste, hot swappable, components facilitates efficient "conveyor belt assembly line" like team development. 

Fully integrated Vue and Angular instances are in the works for both "kitchen sink" and scaled down verions.

SEPARATION OF CONCERNS : : 
* 

FAST (loading) : : 
* 

LOCATION LOCATION LOCATION : : 
* In UX world, context is everything. Let users know what is happening where they are interacting (where they clicked) on the page. Don't make them look around and possibly miss what happened. When they click on a item to see it's profile, the loading animation appears in context where they clicked. Nothing else happens (visually) until the content is fully loaded. Then the loading animation stops and the PROFILE panel slides in with the content. This is a bit of a new content loading visual paradigm but is instantly intuitive for users as they are fully informed (visually in context) throughout the content loading process. 


INTUITIVE MOTION : : 
* 

FEATURES : : (kitchen sink) 
* Fast triage (no ping-pong effect, all content on one screen) 
* Intuitive contextual (on hover) help system (user configurable) 
* Intuitive contextual content loading (user configurable) 
* Intuitive contextual highlighting (user configurable) 
* Intuitive contextual motion (user configurable) 
* Keyboard navigable 
* Shortcut key combinations 
* Right click context menu/functional short cuts 
* Role based vetting/access system

* Optional metrics dashboard (for management/stakeholders) 
* In-app alerting (toasts) 
* Web push notifications 
* User settings page 
* Favorite an item 
* Optional introductory tour 
* Auto, manager, and user tag management system 
* Rearrange-able (drag/drop) components 
* Label, tag, and save user customizations 
* HTML5 router (with options) to enable forward/back browser button and saving cross browser sessions 
* HTML5 user data storage 
* "CSS First" specification (CSS solutions before scripting because CSS is so much faster than JS) 
* Sweep (keep on the latest from a given source) 
* No declared height (squishy GUI, graceful degradation) 
* No absolute positioned elements 
* No sticky header/footer 
* Sub component overflow content scrolling (without JS) (per the "CSS First" specification)
* Full documentation (for developers) 
* Responsive (screen agnostic) 
* Themes 


Adding these to documentation : :
FEATURES : : "kitchen sink" 
* Fast triage (no navigating back and forth between item list and details (ping-pong effect), everything is in one view) 
* Minimal professional look and feel 
* View mode (normal, cozy, compact ala Gmail) 
* Progressively teaches end-users how to use application 
* Intuitive contextual (on hover) help system (user configurable) 
* Intuitive contextual content loading (user configurable) 
* Intuitive contextual highlighting (user configurable) 
* Intuitive contextual motion (user configurable) 
* Keyboard navigable 
* Shortcut key combinations 
* Right click context menu/functional short cuts

* Label, tag, and save user customizations 
* Sweep (keep on the latest from a given source) 
* Full documentation for end-users 
* Responsive (screen agnostic) 
* Light/dark themes 

DEVELOPER FEATURES : : 
* Front-to-back design and implementation (road map for what/how to build, minimizes rework, scope creep, client meetings, time to market) 
* Total separation of GUI logic and data logic (preserves, JS framework agnosticism,  "Future proof" spec,  ) 
* Latest CSS Flexbox spec for layout, interaction, motion, and separation of GUI logic and data logic. 
* "CSS First" spec (CSS solutions preferred over scripting. CSS can be 100x faster than equivalent JS solutions) 
* CSS rules are in order of appearance in the GUI (GUI is a visual map of CSS rules) 
* One central place <body> to control GUI 
* Standard intuitive, contextual, verbose class/id naming conventions 
* Low level developer entry (reduced ramp-up time) (part of "Future Proof" spec) 
* Minimal dependencies 
* HTML5 router (with options) to enable forward/back browser button and saving cross browser sessions
* HTML5 user data storage
* No declared height (squishy GUI, graceful degradation)
* No absolute positioned elements
* No sticky header/footer (uses Flexbox instead)
* Sub component overflow content scrolling (without JS) (per the "CSS First" specification)
* Full documentation for developers
* Preexisting parent DOM elements eliminates time/rendering issues with dynamic content
* Preexisting parent DOM elements ensures smooth animations and a fast a loading process (only load sub-components)


DEVELOPMENT TIERS : : 
* Simplistic front-end perspective of viewing web development from a 10k foot level. 
* Many important moving parts are missing such as security and details of how data goes both up AND down the stack as end-users interact with the GUI and updates/changes the data.

Front-End (FE) : : 

* Front-Front-End (FFE) : : 
*  * Aka "client side", "user facing side", "GUI", "UI", "layout", "look and feel", presentation layer/tier", etc. This is what end-users see and interact with in their web browser. 
*  * Optional UI library(s) such as vanilla Bootstrap, Vuetify, Bootstrap for Vue, and dozens (hundreds) of others that can be mixed/matched or none at all. 
*  * Developers in general either don't have time or the technical skill to build this tier from scratch, meaning actually hand coding the hypertext markup language (HTML) and associated Cascading Style Sheets (CSS).
*  *  * HTML is the GUI's underlying structure (AKA "scaffolding"), like the steel frame of a building or a car.
*  *  * CSS is the look/feel, layout, workflow, and interaction (AKA GUI logic), like a building's outside bricks/texture/colors, windows, doors, vents, crown molding, etc.

- OR -

*  *  * A car's colors, gull-wing doors, adjustable concave mirrors, deep bucket leather seats, (optional faux leopard skin available...), halogen head lights, fancy bladed windshield wipers, 30" mag wheels, ghetto style purple LED under-glow lights, suspensions, and whale tail. Or not... JK 🙂

Back-End (BE) : : 
*Front-Back-End (FBE) : : 
*  * JS Framework such as Angular, React, and Vue
*  * Connects data to the FFE via data services
*  * Can handle both data logic and GUI logic
*  * Among other important functions, it handles data connectivity from the BFE Services Tier to the FFE Presentation Tier through a common "Application Program Interface" or "API".

Back-End (BE) : : 
*  * Back-Front-End (BFE) - Services layer
*  * Back-Back-End (BBE) - Data store (data bases, cloud, etc.)
