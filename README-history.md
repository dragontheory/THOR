# BACKGROUND : :  
The term "Holy Grail" is a client side design term in reference to the type of layout which, in it's simplest form, is three independent scrolling full-screen panels of content with a header and footer.
<br />
<br />

# HISTORY : :  
The "Holy Grail" layout may seem basic and easy to implement but since the 1990's, when it was introduced, front-end designers/developers have been attempting and failing to solve how to adequately code it without the assistance of JavaScript. It has become an infamous ongoing challenge.  

The standard requirements for solving the "Holy Grail" layout puzzle are : :   
Cross/backward (modern) browser compatibility (IE11, Edge, FF 60+, Chrome 60+)  

At least three (two fixed or % width side and one % width center) independent, scroll-able panels (columns)  

Full width header and footer that sticks to the top and bottom of the screen (without JS).  
Hint: the header and footer are actually PUSHED to the top and bottom of the browser window.  

No JavaScript (HTML and CSS only - languages all browsers speak natively)  

An updated modern requirement is that the "Holy Grail" must work with multiple platforms and associated resolutions such as mobile phones, tablets, and laptops in addition to traditional desktops resolutions. The design/development world calls this being "responsive".  

So the label "Holy Grail" is well deserved. No one has been able to do it, as far as I know because the technology simply didn't exist until now. Using Bootstrap's built in advanced CSS Flex-box techniques, I have been able code a solution that satisfies all of the standard "Holy Grail" layout requirements as demonstrated in the links above. In fact, I have been able to extend the solution to include a dashboard in up to five modular, customization, skin-able, and theme-able panels.
