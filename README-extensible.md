# EXTENSIBLE BENEFITS : :  
Bootstrap components are pre-built thus developers can simply copy/paste them into place, hook them up and they are ready to go! This also reduces design/development LoE by up to 50%.  

Bootstrap components are conventional thus end-users are already familiar with how to use them out-of-the-box (minimal training)!  

Vanilla Bootstrap is standards driven, ubiquitous, easy to develop, and has one of the largest (if not THE largest) developer base of support in the world.  

Because they use vanilla Bootstrap (vs Bootstrap plug-ins and or plug-ins of Bootstrap), the thousands of pre-made themes and components created and shared by designers and developers all over the world work with any other vanilla Bootstrap web application.  

Because of the front-to-back nature of the development process, stakeholders are able to see (up front) notional but working versions of functionality/features. Program managers are thus better able to negotiate, gain, and maintain stakeholder "buy-in" and or confidence for current and future development.  

Bootstrap is compatible with Vue, Angular, React, or any other JS framework or no JS framework at all.  

The separation of GUI logic and data logic naturally helps define and promote separate development team roles/responsibilities (AKA swim-lanes) for an efficient (conveyor belt like) team development workflow. 
<br /> 
<br />
FOR EXAMPLE : :  
* The front-front-end (FFE) designer/developer copy/pastes the designed component into place, tests, and pushes changes.
* The front-back-end (FBE) developer hooks in the data provided by back-front-end services (BFE) to the new component, tests, and pushes changes.  
* All changes are pushed to DEV and further tested by non-developers. 
* . . .

A new, better, faster way to do web development.  
1. Front to back design drives development
   1. Developers have a "road map" of what they need to do.
   2. Customers have a "big picture" visual of what to expect.
   3. Mitigates miscommunications between management and developers
   4. Developers/customers/SIs have a reference from which to negotiate/prioritize features/time frames and pick and choose (kitchen style), iterative/Agile sprint development. 
2. Utilize templated W3C Standards compliant vanilla HTML/CSS/JS features/components
   1. Fast copy/paste/plug/play assembly line like development workflow
   2. Fast requirements to release "time to market" turnaround for customers
   3. The more development done up front the faster the "time to market"
   4. Lowers the cognitive load barrier of entry for developers
   5. Saves time = money
   6. Prevents the inevitable O&M slow down
   7. Prevents scope creep
   8. Establishes developer authority over web development thus customers dictating solutions. 
   9. Promotes the idea that customers are experts at what they do and the developers are experts at what they do. Working together creates a perfect solution for them.
3. Total separation of front-end and back-end development (leveraging CSS'  native reactive "listening" nature to detect and 'react' to new GUI stimuli.
   1. Defines developer swim lines
   2. Encourages teamwork
   3. Allows for data agnostic development
4. Minimal dependencies
   1. No third party plug-ins with limited functionality/flexibility
5. Automate where possible
   1. 
5. Convention, convention, convention
   1. Use layouts, design patterns, widgets everyone knows or is stupid intuitive
   2. Utilizes existing user expectations of how a web application works
   3. Pre design/develop top 5/10 most common UI layouts/workflows and features
6. Security
   1. User roles
   2. Encryption
7. Metrics
   1. Manager dashboard
   2. Role based
8. User customization where possible
   1. Ideally customers shut down their browser and the next day they open their browser and continue where they left off. The app is identical to when they left off.
